# Podcast Script: The Rise of the Orange Army: Sunrisers Hyderabad

**Rahul**: Hey Anjali! Aaj let's talk about the team jo silent killers maane jaate hain IPL mein. You know who... The Orange Army, Sunrisers Hyderabad!

**Anjali**: Ah, SRH! Good choice, Rahul. Matlab, inki history actually kaafi interesting hai. You know na they came into the scene in 2012 after the Deccan Chargers were terminated? 2013 mein debut kiya tha unhone.

**Rahul**: Haan, bilkul! And yaar, start mein everyone thought ki bas bowling team hai. Low scoring games defend karna was their superpower. But 2016... uff! Kya saal tha woh!

**Anjali**: Sahi mein! David Warner ki captaincy aur woh batting aggression. They defeated RCB in the final right in Bangalore! That was peak SRH. But honestly, unka recent transformation under Pat Cummins in 2024... that was something else.

**Rahul**: Arre don't remind me! 287 runs against RCB? Matlab video game chal raha tha kya? Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma were just smashing everything. Kahan gayi woh 'defensive bowling team' image?

**Anjali**: Exactly! They shattered the record for the highest IPL total twice in one season. It shows ki ye franchise evolve hona jaanti hai. Also, don't forget Bhuvneshwar Kumar. He's been the backbone since the beginning, haina?

**Rahul**: Oh yes, Bhuvi is a legend. Aur Hyderabad ka crowd... 'Orange Army' ka support next level hota hai Rajiv Gandhi Stadium mein. Biryani and cricket, perfect combo!

**Anjali**: Haha, bilkul sahi kaha. They have had their ups and downs, like losing the 2018 and 2024 finals, but consistency wise... they are one of the best managed teams. Playoff streak from 2016 to 2020 was impressive.

**Rahul**: Correct. Chalo, let's see next season kya dhamaka karte hain. Pat Cummins ka 'silence the crowd' attitude wapas dikhega shayad!
