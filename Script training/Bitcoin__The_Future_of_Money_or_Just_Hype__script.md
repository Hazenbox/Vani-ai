# Podcast Script: Bitcoin: The Future of Money or Just Hype?

**Rahul**: Arre Anjali, aajkal jidhar dekho bas Bitcoin-Bitcoin chal raha hai. Office mein, gym mein... what is the actual scene yaar? Matlab, is it really the future ya bas hawa hai?

**Anjali**: Haha, relax Rahul. Dekh, hype toh hai, but there is solid tech behind it. Simple terms mein, Bitcoin ek decentralized digital currency hai. Invented by someone called Satoshi Nakamoto back in 2008.

**Rahul**: Decentralized matlab? Jaise apna Rupee RBI control karta hai, waisa koi scene nahi hai kya?

**Anjali**: Bilkul sahi pakde! No central bank, no government. It runs on a peer-to-peer network. So, agar mujhe tujhe paise bhejne hain, toh beech mein koi bank ya middleman nahi chahiye. Direct transfer, samjha?

**Rahul**: Oh, sahi hai! But wait, yeh 'Mining' kya cheez hai? Do people actually dig for it... like gold?

**Anjali**: Umm, not literally, baba! Mining is actually a process jahan computers complex mathematical puzzles solve karte hain transactions verify karne ke liye. Jo computer puzzle solve karta hai, usko reward mein naye Bitcoins milte hain. Ye sab ek public ledger pe record hota hai jisko Blockchain kehte hain.

**Rahul**: Hmm... sounds complicated but cool. Toh matlab unlimited paisa chaap sakte hain kya?

**Anjali**: Na, absolutely not. Yahi toh catch hai! Total supply is capped at 21 million coins. Usse zyada Bitcoin kabhi ban hi nahi sakte. That's why log isse 'Digital Gold' bolte hain because it's scarce.

**Rahul**: Accha... toh scarcity ki wajah se value badhti hai. Sahi hai boss. So, should I invest my salary? Ameer ban jaunga na?

**Anjali**: Arre hold your horses! Market bohot volatile hai yaar. Aaj price upar, kal bohot neeche. It uses a lot of electricity too, toh environmental concerns bhi hain. It's revolutionary tech, but risky hai. Soch samajh kar hi ghusna, samjha na?
