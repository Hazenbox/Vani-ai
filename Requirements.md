# Vani AI - Hinglish Podcast Generator

## The Task
Build a Python pipeline that takes a Wikipedia article (e.g., about "Mumbai Indians"), generates a natural-sounding 2-minute conversation script between two people in Hinglish (using an LLM), and then converts it into audio using a TTS API (OpenAI/ElevenLabs/Bark).

## The Constraint
The audio must sound conversational (interruptions, "umm," "achcha," laughter). It cannot sound robotic.

## The Deliverable
- The Python Script (Colab link).
- One MP3 sample.
- A 100-word explanation of how you prompted the LLM to get "Hinglish" style right.

## What is Vani AI?
Vani AI is a web application that transforms any article/webpage URL into an AI-generated Hinglish podcast - a natural two-person conversation in a mix of Hindi and English.

### Hosts
- **Rahul**: Enthusiastic, casual male host
- **Anjali**: Expert, knowledgeable female host

## Current Status
It's all built using Gemini AI, Gemini APIs, Gemini SDKs. But as it's a hackathon I should build this product with Python.

## Judge's Reading of the Brief (Important)

### What the judges explicitly want

| Item | Interpretation |
|------|----------------|
| "Build a Python pipeline" | Python must be the primary orchestrator, not optional |
| Wikipedia article input | URL → text extraction must be visible |
| LLM-generated script | Clear text artifact |
| 2-minute Hinglish conversation | Time-bounded, not vague |
| Conversational audio | Interruptions, fillers, laughter are mandatory |
| Colab link | Must run end-to-end in Python |
| MP3 sample | Generated by the pipeline |
| 100-word explanation | Prompting strategy must be articulated |

> 🚨 **If Python is missing or minimized, you risk disqualification, even if the product is superior.**

## Reality Check: Your Current Build vs Brief

### What you already do better than most teams
- Semantic URL ingestion (Gemini)
- Native multi-speaker TTS
- Highly natural conversation
- Minimal orchestration overhead

### Where it fails the brief

| Requirement | Current Status |
|-------------|----------------|
| Python pipeline | ❌ Missing |
| Colab runnable | ❌ Missing |
| Explicit text cleaning | ❌ Implicit |
| Model-agnostic | ❌ Gemini-specific |
| Explainable prompting | ⚠️ Implicit |

## Migration Strategy (Python-First, Model-Constrained)

### Core Principle
Recreate the pipeline explicitly in Python, while preserving Gemini-level output quality using constraints + prompting.

### Target Python Architecture

```
Wikipedia URL
     ↓
Python fetch + clean
     ↓
Constrained LLM prompt
     ↓
Structured Hinglish script (JSON)
     ↓
TTS synthesis (multi-call if needed)
     ↓
MP3 output
```

## Important note
Dont change any UI elements, I just want to migrate to python

## Evaluation Criteria:
Projects will be evaluated based on:

- Innovation and Creativity: Originality and uniqueness of the solution.
- Technical Complexity: Depth and sophistication of AI models and algorithms.
- Code Quality: Cleanliness, readability, and maintainability of the code.
- Testing and Reliability: Coverage and effectiveness of unit tests.
- Documentation: Clarity and completeness of the technical design document.
- Demo Quality: Effectiveness and clarity of the demo video.
- All projects must include comprehensive unit test cases to ensure robustness and reliability of the code.


### If you miss any of the above, you are eliminated!
