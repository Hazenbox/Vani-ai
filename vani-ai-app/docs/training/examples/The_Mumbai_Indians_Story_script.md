# Podcast Script: Paltan Ki Power: The Mumbai Indians Story

**Rahul**: Arey Anjali, jab bhi IPL ka topic uthta hai na, sabse pehle dimaag mein ek hi naam aata hai—Mumbai Indians! Matlab, 'Duniya Hila Denge' is not just a slogan, it’s a vibe, hai na?

**Anjali**: Haha, bilkul Rahul! And honestly, facts bhi yahi bolte hain. I mean, they are arguably the most successful team in IPL history. Paanch titles jeetna—2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, aur 2020 mein—koi mazaak thodi hai yaar.

**Rahul**: Sahi mein! Aur socho, shuru mein toh struggle tha. First few seasons mein itna kuch khaas nahi kiya tha. But jab Rohit Sharma captain bane... uff, game changer! Woh 'Hitman' era toh legendary tha.

**Anjali**: Hundred percent. Rohit ki captaincy was crucial, but credit Reliance Industries ko bhi jaata hai. As owners, unhone team ko bohot aggressively back kiya hai. Did you know MI is consistently one of the most valuable brands in the league? Unki brand value $87 million ke aas-paas estimate ki gayi thi recently.

**Rahul**: Baap re! Reliance hai toh paisa toh hoga hi, but talent scouting bhi solid hai inki. Like, look at Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya. Yeh sab MI ne hi toh groom kiye hain na? Wankhede Stadium mein jab 'Mumbai Mumbai' chillate hain fans... goosebumps aa jate hain!

**Anjali**: Oh, totally! Wankhede is a fortress. Aur sirf IPL nahi, unhone Champions League T20 bhi do baar jeeta hai—2011 aur 2013 mein. So, they aren't just local kings, global T20 circuit mein bhi dominance dikhaya hai unhone. Their rivalry with CSK is basically the 'El Clasico' of cricket.

**Rahul**: Arre haan, MI vs CSK toh emotion hai bhai! Jeet kisi ki bhi ho, entertainment full on hota hai. Chalo, let's see iss baar Paltan kya naya karti hai!
