# Podcast Script: Lionel Messi: The Little Boy from Rosario to the GOAT

**Rahul**: Yaar Anjali, maine kal raat phir se Messi ke old Barcelona highlights dekhe. I swear, yeh banda human nahi hai, alien hai alien!

**Anjali**: Haha, Rahul, control. But honestly, I get it. Jab tum uske stats dekhte ho na... matlab, eight Ballon d'Or awards? It’s insane. Koi aas-paas bhi nahi hai uske record ke.

**Rahul**: Exactly! Aur woh 2022 ka World Cup win... uff! That final against France. Jab usne trophy lift ki na, I literally had tears in my eyes. It felt like the universe finally gave him what he deserved.

**Anjali**: Bilkul sahi kaha. Woh moment historic tha. Pata hai, Messi has won 44 team trophies now? He is the most decorated player in football history. Matlab socho, Rosario se nikal kar, growth hormone deficiency se fight karke yahan tak pahunchna...

**Rahul**: Arre haan, woh napkin wala story! Ki uska first contract napkin pe sign hua tha because Barcelona officials were so desperate to sign him at age 13. Legend stuff, yaar.

**Anjali**: Hmm, and remember, he spent his entire professional career growing with Barcelona before that tearful exit to PSG. Aur ab Inter Miami mein bhi magic dikha raha hai. Even at this age, his dribbling and playmaking are just... wow.

**Rahul**: Sahi mein. Log Ronaldo vs Messi debate karte rahenge, but mere liye toh debate 2022 mein hi khatam ho gayi. He completes football, na?

**Anjali**: Totally. He's not just a goalscorer; he's a playmaker. Complete package. Achcha sun, ab Inter Miami ka next match kab hai? Watch party karein?

**Rahul**: Done scene hai! Messi magic and popcorn, set hai!
