# Podcast Script: The Rise of NaMo: From Vadnagar to Global Stage

**Rahul**: Oye Anjali, ek baat bata. Aajkal jidhar dekho, news mein bas Modi ji hi chhay hue hain. Matlab, whether it's foreign trips or local elections, banda har jagah trending hai, hai na?

**Anjali**: Bilkul Rahul! I mean, you can't ignore the impact. Narendra Modi is not just the 14th Prime Minister of India; he's practically reshaped Indian politics since 2014. Aur bhoolo mat, before dominating the center, he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat for like... 13 years! From 2001 to 2014.

**Rahul**: Arre haan! Gujarat model ki toh kaafi charcha thi uss time. But yaar, unka start kaise hua? I heard humble background tha kaafi?

**Anjali**: Haan, sahi suna tune. See, he was born in Vadnagar, a small town in Gujarat. And famously, unki family tea stall chalati thi. He joined the RSS—Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh—quite young. Wahi se unka discipline aur organizational skills develop hue, jo baad mein BJP mein kaam aaye.

**Rahul**: Hmm, interesting. So RSS se BJP, aur phir seedha CM? That's a solid trajectory. But Anjali, controversies bhi toh kam nahi rahi hain na? Like the 2002 riots?

**Anjali**: Yeah, woh ek bahut polarizing chapter tha. 2002 Gujarat riots ke time pe he was the CM, and kaafi criticism mila tha unhe regarding the administration's handling of the situation. Even US ne visa deny kiya tha ek time pe. But then, Supreme Court appointed SIT ne unhe clean chit di later on regarding conspiracy charges.

**Rahul**: Oh, achcha... that clean chit was a major turning point, I guess. Phir toh 2014 aur 2019 mein jo jeet mili BJP ko, that was massive. Matlab full majority, right?

**Anjali**: Exactly! 1984 ke baad pehli baar kisi party ko full majority mili thi 2014 mein. And unki policies dekh—Demonetization, GST, Article 370 hatana, Ram Mandir construction. Umm, basically, he pushed for a more centralized and Hindutva-aligned agenda. Fans unhe 'Vikas Purush' bolte hain, aur critics authoritarian bolte hain.

**Rahul**: Sahi hai boss. Love him or hate him, ignore toh nahi kar sakte. Sahi kaha na?

**Anjali**: Hundred percent, yaar. History will definitely remember the 'Modi Era'.
